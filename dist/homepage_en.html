			<h2>Jarda</h2>
			<p class="about-guys__text">
				For the last 5 years, I've been developing websites and applications with the focus on front-end. I'm interested in trendy and modern technologies. Lately, I've been blown away by blockchain and decentralized projects based on Bitcoin technology. I'm focused primarily on creating applications using javascript (React.js), traveling the world and enjoying it all.

			<h2>Jakub</h2>
			<p class="about-guys__text">
				For more than 7 years I've been doing online business for living. In 2011 I set up a development company, which I had sold in 2015 and got back to freelancing as a developer. I really like clean, testable and readable code, which is supported by design patterns. I have managerial experience and I like to lead a team of developers and encourage them to write quality code with me giving them examples. I graduated from the Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Information Technologies and I'm helping my girlfriend with her sweet business <a href="http://www.tartaletka.cz" target="_blank" title="Tartaletka">www.tartaletka.cz</a>.

		<h3 class="title">What's happened?</h3>
		<p>
			In the beginning of 2016, we started to work on an app for collectors (<a href="https://www.fullpast.com" target="_blank">www.fullpast.com</a>), something like e-bay for collectors. Unfortunately, client ran out of money and project was terminated from day to day.

		<p>
			The Fullpast front end is a single page app in <strong>React.js</strong>,

		</p>

		<p>Backend runs on <strong>PHP 7 and Laravel</strong> 5.3. Images from collectors are being stored on an <strong>AWS S3</strong>,
			cache with <strong>Redis</strong>, search via <strong>ElasticSearch</strong>.
			Automatic deployment thanks to combination of <strong>Gitlab CI and Envoyer</strong> within zero downtime.
			The code is covered by <strong>unit, integration and acceptance tests</strong>.
